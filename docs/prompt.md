You are tasked with implementing improvements and fixes for the TopSmile project.  
All instructions for what to implement are contained in the document `docs/topsmile_fullstack_review.md`.  
Do not invent new issues or solutions. Follow the document exactly.  

- Only implement fixes, improvements, or roadmap steps that are explicitly described in the document.  
- If something is ambiguous, mark it as **“assumption”** and explain why. Do not hallucinate.  
- Apply **one fix at a time**.  
- After each fix, run **only the single related test file** (or individual test) instead of the full suite.  
- Confirm that the fix works before moving to the next issue.  
- Always reference the section of `topsmile_fullstack_review.md` that justifies the change.
