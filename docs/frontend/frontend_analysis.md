The codebase shows excellent attention to Brazilian market localization and accessibility standards.

## Technical Architecture

### Core Technology Stack

**Frontend Framework & Language**
- **React 18.2.0** with TypeScript 4.9.5
- **React Router DOM 6.30.1** for client-side routing
- **Strict TypeScript configuration** with full type safety

**UI/UX Libraries**
- **Framer Motion 10.16.5** for smooth animations
- **React Icons 4.12.0** for iconography
- **React Slick 0.29.0** with Slick Carousel for carousels
- **React Calendar 6.0.0** for appointment scheduling

**Development & Testing Infrastructure**

- **Cypress 15.1.0** for end-to-end testing
- **MSW 2.11.1** for API mocking during development
- **MongoDB Memory Server** for testing database scenarios

### Application Architecture Patterns

**1. Multi-layered Error Boundary System**
The application implements a sophisticated three-tier error handling system:
- **Critical Level**: Application-wide failures with full recovery options
- **Page Level**: Route-specific errors with navigation fallbacks
- **Component Level**: Localized errors with retry mechanisms

Each error boundary includes:
- Unique error ID generation for support tracking
- Automatic retry mechanisms with configurable limits
- Error reporting to monitoring services in production
- Developer-friendly debugging in development mode
- Portuguese-localized user-friendly error messages

**2. Dual Authentication Architecture**
The system supports two distinct user flows:
- **Admin Authentication**: Role-based access (super_admin, admin, manager, dentist, assistant)
- **Patient Authentication**: Patient portal access with medical data integration

Both systems feature:
- JWT access/refresh token management
- Cross-tab logout synchronization
- Automatic token refresh with concurrent request handling
- Role-based route protection

**3. Comprehensive State Management**
- **Context-based global state** for authentication and errors
- **Custom hooks architecture** with `useApiState` as a base pattern
