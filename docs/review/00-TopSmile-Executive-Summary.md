## Top 5 High-Priority Issues

### 1. **Inconsistent Service Layer Implementation** 🔴 CRITICAL
**Impact:** Maintainability, Code Duplication  
**Location:** `backend/src/services/`

**Problem:**
- `appointmentService.ts` has duplicate methods with different signatures
- Some services extend `BaseService`, others don't
- Inconsistent error handling patterns
- Missing service methods referenced in routes

**Example:**
```typescript
// appointmentService has both:
cancelAppointment(id: string, clinicId: string, reason: string)
cancelAppointment(id: string, reason: string) // Missing clinicId
```

**Recommendation:**
- Standardize all services to extend `BaseService`
- Create consistent method signatures across services
- Implement service interfaces for type safety
- Add comprehensive service layer tests

**Effort:** 3-5 days | **Priority:** HIGH

---

### 2. **Route-Service Signature Mismatches** 🔴 CRITICAL
**Impact:** Runtime Errors, Production Bugs  
**Location:** `backend/src/routes/scheduling/appointments.ts`

**Problem:**
- Routes call service methods with incorrect parameters
- `schedulingService` wrapper doesn't match `appointmentService` implementation
- Missing error handling for service method failures

**Example:**
```typescript
// Route calls:
await schedulingService.getAppointments(clinicId, start, end, providerId, status);

// But service expects:
getAppointments(clinicId: string, filters: AppointmentFilters)
```

**Recommendation:**
- Audit all route-service interactions
- Create integration tests for all endpoints
- Add TypeScript strict mode checks
- Implement service method contracts

**Effort:** 2-3 days | **Priority:** CRITICAL

---

### 3. **Missing Database Indexes** 🟡 HIGH
**Impact:** Performance, Scalability  
**Location:** Multiple models

**Problem:**
- Patient model lacks indexes for common queries (search, filtering)
- Provider model missing availability query indexes
- No composite indexes for multi-field queries
- Text search indexes not optimized

**Recommendation:**
- Add compound indexes for list/filter queries
- Implement text search indexes for patient/provider search
- Add sparse indexes for optional fields (email, CPF)
- Run index analysis script and monitor slow queries

**Effort:** 1-2 days | **Priority:** HIGH

---

### 4. **Frontend State Management Inconsistency** 🟡 MEDIUM
**Impact:** Code Complexity, Maintainability  
**Location:** `src/` (frontend)

**Problem:**
- Mix of Zustand, Context API, and TanStack Query for state
- No clear pattern for when to use each
- Some components fetch data directly instead of using hooks
- Duplicate API calls in different components

**Recommendation:**
- Document state management strategy
- Use TanStack Query exclusively for server state
- Use Zustand for global client state
- Use Context only for auth and theme
- Create custom hooks for all data fetching

**Effort:** 3-4 days | **Priority:** MEDIUM

---

### 5. **Incomplete Error Handling in Frontend** 🟡 MEDIUM
**Impact:** User Experience, Debugging  
**Location:** `src/services/api/`, `src/components/`

**Problem:**
- Inconsistent error message display
- Some API errors not caught
- No retry logic for failed requests
- Missing loading states in some components

**Recommendation:**
- Implement global error boundary with retry
- Add TanStack Query retry configuration
- Standardize error toast notifications
- Add loading skeletons to all data-dependent components

**Effort:** 2-3 days | **Priority:** MEDIUM

---

## Risk Assessment

### Unaddressed High-Risk Issues

#### 1. **Production Monitoring** 🔴
- No APM (Application Performance Monitoring) integration
- No error tracking service (Sentry, Rollbar)
- No uptime monitoring
- No alerting system

**Mitigation:** Implement Sentry + Datadog/New Relic before production launch

#### 2. **Data Backup Strategy** 🔴
- No documented backup procedures
- No disaster recovery plan
- No data retention policy

**Mitigation:** Implement automated MongoDB backups with point-in-time recovery

#### 3. **Load Testing** 🟡
- No load testing performed
- Unknown system capacity
- No auto-scaling configuration

**Mitigation:** Perform k6 load tests, establish baseline capacity

#### 4. **Security Audit** 🟡
- No third-party security audit
- No penetration testing
- OWASP compliance not verified

**Mitigation:** Schedule security audit before production launch
