# Frontend Failed Tests - Root Cause Resolution Plan

This document outlines a **root cause-driven TODO checklist** organized by test suite. The goal is not just to silence errors, but to identify and fix the underlying problems in the codebase to prevent future regressions.

## Resolution Principles

- [ ] **Reproduce Failures**: Run failing tests individually to confirm reproducibility.
- [ ] **Root Cause Analysis**: Identify whether the issue lies in the implementation, test setup, or environment.
- [ ] **Code Improvements**: Apply meaningful fixes to prevent recurrence (not just adjusting test expectations).
- [ ] **Regression Testing**: Re-run the full test suite and related modules to validate stability.
