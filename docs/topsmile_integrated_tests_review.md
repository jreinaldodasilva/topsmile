# TopSmile — Integrated Static Review of Testing Setup and Test Code

> Deliverable: full static analysis + prioritized TODOs + examples + run instructions + integrated best approaches from two reviews.
> Scope: repository static analysis (no tests run).
> Assumptions: Based on two review documents, integrating strengths.

## Executive summary (TL;DR)

* **Backend**: Jest + `ts-jest` configured with `MongoDB Memory Server` for isolation. Unit and integration tests exist, using `supertest` and custom matchers. Coverage reports present.
* **Frontend**: React app with Jest + RTL + MSW for mocking. Extensive test suite with utilities and mocks. MSW handlers cover many endpoints but risk drift from backend.
* **Cypress (E2E)**: Configured with `baseUrl`, tests for key flows. Missing CI orchestration and some edge cases like mobile/deep-linking.
* **Gaps & risks**:
  * Cypress config needs CI-safe orchestration (e.g., `start-server-and-test`).
  * MSW handlers must sync with backend routes/DTOs to avoid false positives.
  * Backend: Remove `forceExit` to fix open handles; add concurrency/overlap tests.
  * Frontend: Ensure selectors are resilient; test error/loading states.
  * Overall: Separate test runs in CI; add coverage thresholds.
* **Strengths**: Solid foundation with comprehensive tests; good isolation practices.

## What I inspected (files / locations)

* Root: `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `jest.config.js`, `cypress.config.js`.
* Backend: `backend/jest.config.js`, `backend/tests/setup.ts`, `backend/tests/unit/`, `backend/tests/integration/`, `backend/coverage/`.
* Frontend: `src/setupTests.ts`, `src/mocks/handlers.ts`, `src/tests/`, `src/__mocks__/`.
* Cypress: `cypress/e2e/`.

# 1) Test Infrastructure Review

### Backend (Jest + ts-jest)

**What’s present**
* `backend/jest.config.js` with `preset: 'ts-jest'`, `testEnvironment: 'node'`, `setupFilesAfterEnv: ['<rootDir>/tests/setup.ts']`, coverage config, `forceExit: true` (to remove), `detectOpenHandles: true`.
* `tests/setup.ts` starts `MongoMemoryServer`, cleans DB, sets JWT secret.
* Tests use `supertest` for integration, `testHelpers.ts` for fixtures.

**Notes / Recommendations**
* Remove `forceExit: true` to identify and fix open handles (e.g., timers in token blacklist).
* Ensure `transformIgnorePatterns` handles ESM deps.
* Coverage: Exclude config files; aim for thresholds.

### Frontend (Jest + RTL + MSW)

**What’s present**
* `src/setupTests.ts` starts MSW server with `beforeAll`, `afterEach`, `afterAll`.
* `src/mocks/handlers.ts` mocks `/api/*` endpoints.
* Test utilities in `src/tests/utils/`.

**Notes / Recommendations**
* Ensure MSW version supports handlers (e.g., `http.*` for v1+).
* Sync handlers with backend DTOs; add contract tests.
* Use resilient selectors: `getByRole`, `getByLabelText`.

### MSW alignment & mocks

* Handlers cover auth, appointments, etc. Risk: Drift from backend changes.
* Recommendation: Automate sync checks or manual reviews.

### Cypress

**What's present**
* `cypress.config.js` with `baseUrl: 'http://localhost:3000'`.
* Tests in `cypress/e2e/`.

**Issues**
* No CI orchestration; add `start-server-and-test`.
* Missing: Mobile viewports, deep-linking, error recovery.

**Recommendation**
* Add `cypress:ci` script; support files for commands.

# 2) Backend Testing — static audit & recommendations

### What I found
* Unit tests for services (scheduling, auth); integration with `supertest`.
* `customMatchers.ts`, `testHelpers.ts` for DRY.

### Specific checks
* MongoDB Memory Server: Correct isolation.
* Auth: Tests create users/JWT.

### Coverage gaps
* Controller-level integration tests missing for HTTP semantics.
* Concurrency/race conditions for scheduling.
* Edge cases: DST, timezone overlaps.

### Suggested additional tests
* Supertest for routes: 400/409/500 responses.
* Concurrency: Parallel booking attempts.
* Validation: Malicious inputs, sanitization.

---

# 3) Frontend Testing — audit & recommendations

### What I found
* Tests for components, contexts, services.
* MSW for mocking; test-utils for providers.

### MSW alignment
* Covers many endpoints; ensure shapes match backend.

### Coverage gaps & suggested tests
* Loading/error states with MSW overrides.
* Calendar: Mock Date for determinism.
* Selectors: Prefer accessible queries.

---

# 4) End-to-End (Cypress) — static analysis

### What exists
* Config and tests for login, appointment, error handling.

### Missing / problematic items
* CI orchestration: Start app before tests.
* Viewports, deep-linking, network errors.

### Recommendations
* Add `cy.login()` command.
* Tests for mobile, recovery flows.

---

# 5) Code quality in tests (patterns & refactor opportunities)

### Strengths
* Centralized helpers; MSW usage.

### Issues / brittle patterns
* Hard-coded strings; `forceExit`.
* Selectors: Use roles/labels.

### Refactor suggestions
* Standardize test-utils; reset caches.
* Prefer `findBy*` for async.

---

# 6) Prioritized Plan for Improvements (actionable TODOs)

### Top 5 fixes
1. Add Cypress CI orchestration (`start-server-and-test`).
2. Sync MSW with backend; add contract checks.
3. Remove `forceExit`; fix open handles.
4. Add concurrency/overlap tests (backend).
5. Separate test runs in CI.

### Secondary tasks
* Add DST/timezone tests.
* Improve selectors.
* Add mobile Cypress tests.
* Set coverage thresholds.

# 7) Example code snippets

## A. Cypress config with CI script
```js
// cypress.config.js
export default {
  e2e: {
    baseUrl: 'http://localhost:3000',
    specPattern: 'cypress/e2e/**/*.cy.js',
    supportFile: 'cypress/support/index.js',
    viewportWidth: 1280,
    viewportHeight: 720,
  },
};
```

## B. Cypress support commands
```js
// cypress/support/commands.js
Cypress.Commands.add('login', (email, password) => {
  cy.request('POST', '/api/auth/login', { email, password }).then((resp) => {
    window.localStorage.setItem('token', resp.body.data.accessToken);
  });
});
```

## C. Backend concurrency test
```ts
// backend/tests/unit/services/schedulingConcurrency.test.ts
it('prevents double booking under concurrency', async () => {
  // Simulate parallel creates; assert only one succeeds.
});
```

## D. Frontend error state test
```tsx
// src/tests/components/LoginForm.test.tsx
server.use(rest.post('/api/auth/login', (req, res, ctx) => res(ctx.status(401))));
test('shows error on invalid login', async () => {
  // Assert error message appears.
});
```

# 8) How to run tests locally

### Backend
```bash
cd backend
npm test
```

### Frontend
```bash
npm run test:frontend
```

### Cypress
```bash
npm run dev  # Start app
npm run cy:run
```

### CI
Use `start-server-and-test` for orchestration.

---

# 9) CI/CD considerations

* MSW drift.
* Open handles.

---

# 11) Prioritized full TODO list
