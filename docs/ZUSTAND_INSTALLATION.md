# Zustand Installation

## Installation Command
```bash
npm install zustand
```

## Version
- zustand: ^4.4.0 (or latest stable)

## Purpose
Zustand is a lightweight state management library for React that will replace Context API for global state management.

## Benefits
- Simpler API than Redux
- No boilerplate code
- Better performance than Context API
- TypeScript support out of the box
- Smaller bundle size

## Next Steps
After installation:
1. Create app store for global application state
2. Create clinical store for clinical features
3. Migrate AuthContext to Zustand
4. Update components to use stores

## Installation Status
⚠️ **Manual Step Required**: Run `npm install zustand` in the project root directory.

This is marked as complete in the refactoring plan, but the actual npm installation must be performed manually.
