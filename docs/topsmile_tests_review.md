You will review, fix, and run the **backend tests** of the TopSmile project.  

⚠️ Strict Rules:  
- The backend source code should only be modified when absolutely necessary.  
- Fix **one failing test at a time**, then rerun it before moving on.  
- Each fix must adapt the test to the existing project code — do not invent new functionality.  
- Always explain what was fixed and why.  

## Workflow
1. **Run Tests**  
   - Start by running all tests (`npm test` or equivalent).  
   - Collect and list failing tests with error messages.  

2. **Fix One Test at a Time**  
   - Select the first failing test.  
   - Explain the change and how it matches the project code.  
   - Rerun just that test to confirm it passes.  
   - Stop and report results before continuing.  

3. **Repeat**  
   - Continue fixing failing tests one by one until the suite passes.  
   - Never modify multiple tests at once.  
   - Do not skip tests — every failing test must be addressed.
