Nice — I pulled the list of raw GitHub links you uploaded and inspected the backend sources referenced there. I focused on the core files that define architecture, authentication, scheduling/availability, data models, and the main services/routes. The list you provided is here.&#x20;

Below is a comprehensive, structured audit: what I reviewed, important findings, concrete risks, and prioritized recommendations (with pointers to exact files/lines you can change). I’ve woven citations to the exact files I used so you can jump to the lines I’m referring to.

# 0) What I looked at (high-level)

I inspected the project entry, config, middleware, models, core services for auth/scheduling/availability, and many routes. Representative files I used heavily in this analysis:

* app / infra: src/app.ts. ([GitHub][1])
* package / deps: package.json. ([GitHub][2])
* DB config: src/config/database.ts. ([GitHub][3])
* Auth and tokens: src/services/authService.ts, src/services/patientAuthService.ts, src/models/RefreshToken.ts. ([GitHub][4])
* Token blacklist: src/services/tokenBlacklistService.ts. ([GitHub][5])
* User/patient models: src/models/User.ts, src/models/Patient.ts, src/models/PatientUser.ts. ([GitHub][6])
* Provider/appointments: src/models/Provider.ts, src/models/Appointment.ts, src/models/AppointmentType.ts. ([GitHub][7])
* Scheduling & availability logic: src/services/availabilityService.ts and src/services/schedulingService.ts. ([GitHub][8])
* Email: src/services/emailService.ts. ([GitHub][9])
* Core routes: src/routes/auth.ts and src/routes/patientAuth.ts. ([GitHub][10])

(If you want a fully enumerated list of every file I opened, I can paste it; I started from the link file you uploaded and examined the core files named above. )

# 1) High-level architecture (summary)

* Tech stack: Node + Express, TypeScript, Mongoose (MongoDB). Dependencies and scripts are in package.json. ([GitHub][2])
* Layering: routes → controllers/services → models (Mongoose). There is a clear separation between services (authService, schedulingService, availabilityService, appointmentService) and models. ([GitHub][4])
* Scheduling is a first-class concern: there are dedicated services for availability generation, booking with transactions, and conflict detection. The code uses date-fns/date-fns-tz to handle timezone-aware parsing. ([GitHub][8])

Overall: the architecture is conventional and sensible for a scheduling/clinic product.

---

# 2) Positive design points (what’s done well)

* **Token rotation + refresh token DB** — refresh tokens are stored in the DB (RefreshToken model) with TTL indexing and `isRevoked` flags, and authService implements rotation (revoke used refresh token, create a new one). That’s a robust pattern. ([GitHub][11])
* **Transactions for booking/reschedule** — schedulingService uses mongoose sessions/transactions to avoid race conditions when creating/rescheduling appointments (and skips transactions in test env). This is a good approach if your Mongo deployment supports replica sets. ([GitHub][12])
* **Schema validation & pre-save normalization** — models include validation functions (CPF/CNPJ/phone), field normalisation (phone/CNPJ/CEP formatting), and schema-level checks. That reduces bad data. ([GitHub][13])
* **Helmet / CORS / rate-limits** — app.ts enables helmet, tuned CORS, and rate limiting on sensitive endpoints (auth/contact). Good security hygiene. ([GitHub][1])
* **Password hashing & account lockout** — User and PatientUser hash with bcrypt (bcryptjs) and have loginAttempts/lockUntil logic to mitigate brute force. ([GitHub][6])

---

# 3) Main concerns & concrete issues (priority ordered)

### A — Token blacklisting is in-memory: not safe for multi-instance production (HIGH)

* `tokenBlacklistService` stores blacklisted access tokens in an in-process `Map` with periodic cleanup. This means:

  * Blacklist is lost on process restart.
  * Blacklisted tokens are not visible to other app instances (if you run >1 container/replica). ([GitHub][5])
* **Impact:** a revoked access token might remain valid on other instances until expiry. This defeats logout-with-access-token revocation and complicates security compliance.
* **Fix (short):** move blacklist to a centralized store (Redis with TTL). Use a Redis SET or a key per token with TTL equal to token expiry. Example architecture: `SETEX token:<tokenHash> 3600 1`. Use token hash instead of full token string for storage.
* **Files to change:** tokenBlacklistService (replace Map with Redis client), and any code that reads it (authService). ([GitHub][5])

---

### B — Transactions are good, but Mongo transactions require replica set (MED-HIGH)

* schedulingService uses transactions (startSession / startTransaction) — this **requires** MongoDB replica set or cloud DB that supports transactions. If deployment uses a standalone Mongo, transactions will not work. ([GitHub][12])
* **Risk:** silent failures or fallback to non-transactional code paths causing race conditions.
* **Fix:** detect at startup and either:

  * enforce replicas/Atlas, or
  * provide an optimistic-lock / DB-level unique constraint fallback (e.g., a booking collection with a uniqueness index on provider + start time slot or use `findOneAndUpdate` with `$setOnInsert` and a unique constraint). Add health check for transaction support. ([GitHub][12])

---

### C — Availability/slot generation: heavy memory / CPU potential (MEDIUM)

* `availabilityService.generateAvailability` builds slot arrays and has protective limits (maxDays, max slots per day) — good — but large date ranges can still be expensive. There are warnings and chunking, but:

  * `timeParseCache` uses an in-memory Map with manual clearing — good micro-optim, but again single-instance. ([GitHub][8])
* Conflict detection scans appointments; that’s O(n) per slot generation. For very busy providers or many requested days, this will be slow.
* **Fixes:**

  * Put a strict upper bound for range requests (e.g., maxDays = 30 for public APIs).
  * Add server-side caching (Redis) for precomputed availability (invalidate on booking/reschedule).
  * Use optimized queries to limit fetched appointment ranges and apply binary-search style overlap detection (the code uses an optimized loop already — good). ([GitHub][8])

---

### D — Token secrets / environment handling (MEDIUM)

* The code validates many env vars in `app.ts`. Good. However authService and patientAuthService have fallback behavior that prints warnings or uses dev defaults for local runs. Make sure production never runs with fallback secrets. ([GitHub][4])
* patientAuthService warns if patient secret equals staff secret — that’s good. Continue to keep secrets separate. ([GitHub][14])

---

### E — Black/white listing of domains + CORS complexity (LOW-MED)

* app.ts CORS allows requests with no origin (for Postman / mobile). That’s sometimes necessary but can open unexpected access patterns. Validate that you really want `if (!origin) return callback(null, true);`. If not required, tighten it. ([GitHub][1])

---

### F — Token/refresh management corner cases (LOW-MED)

* AuthService removes older refresh tokens but logic for cleanup uses `tokens.slice(this.MAX_REFRESH_TOKENS_PER_USER - 1)` — check off-by-one: if MAX=5 and tokens.length = 5, slice(4) returns last token. The code’s intention is to keep the latest N and revoke the rest — confirm the slice indices. ([GitHub][4])
* Also ensure `RefreshToken` TTL index is set and functioning (`expiresAt` with `expireAfterSeconds: 0`) — model has that. Good. ([GitHub][11])

---

### G — Duplicate / overlapping logic (code quality & maintenance risk) (LOW-MED)

* There are **two** scheduling/appointment code paths: `appointmentService` and `schedulingService`. Both contain overlap / conflict logic. This can easily drift and cause inconsistent behavior between different API endpoints. Consolidate into a single scheduling service used by all routes. ([GitHub][15])

---

### H — Inconsistent typing / some `any` use (LOW)

* Many service functions do thorough TypeScript typing, but there are still `any` or broad return types in places. Tighten typings to reduce runtime surprises. ([GitHub][4])

---

# 4) Security checklist — things to verify / enforce (actionable)

1. **Redis for ephemeral/shared state**: move token blacklist and availability cache to Redis so multiple instances behave consistently. (tokenBlacklistService -> Redis, availability cache -> Redis). ([GitHub][5])
2. **Enforce strong secrets in CI / deployment**: `JWT_SECRET`, `DATABASE_URL`, `SENDGRID_API_KEY` must be present (app.ts already enforces in production). Ensure secrets are stored securely. ([GitHub][1])
3. **Run `npm audit` / Snyk**: check dependencies for known CVEs (express, jsonwebtoken, nodemailer, etc.). I inspected package.json but cannot determine CVEs without running audit. ([GitHub][2])
4. **Database transaction readiness**: ensure Mongo is deployed as a replica set or adapt code to fallback mechanisms. ([GitHub][12])
5. **Avoid storing tokens in logs**: I saw console logs in a few places (email verification token printed, etc.) — be careful not to log secrets in prod. Example: patientAuthService logs verification tokens to console for now. That’s okay in dev but should be replaced by email delivery in prod. ([GitHub][14])

---

# 5) Performance & scaling recommendations (actionable)

* **Use Redis** for:

  * token blacklist (fast membership checks + TTL)
  * availability caching / precomputed day slots
  * rate-limiting with shared counters if running multiple instances (express-rate-limit has a Redis store)
* **Add unique reservation mechanism**: consider a booking anchor collection with unique index `(providerId, startIntervalBucket)` to prevent double bookings in high-concurrency situations (complement stance: keep transactions but also have DB uniqueness on canonical time buckets).
* **Profile availability queries** in production with real data; if providers have many appointments per day, ensure queries use proper indexes (Appointment model has many indexes — good). ([GitHub][16])

---

# 6) Maintainability / developer experience

* **Consolidate scheduling logic** to avoid divergence between `appointmentService` and `schedulingService`. One canonical API/service for availability & booking. ([GitHub][15])
* **Add unit + integration tests** around:

  * token rotation and revoke flows,
  * booking race-condition simulations,
  * availability generation limits, and
  * email sending (mocked).
* **Add structured logging** (e.g., pino) with request correlation IDs for debugging production incidents instead of console.log.
* **CI / pre-merge checks**: run TypeScript compile, lint, tests, security audit.

---

# 7) Small code issues / nitpicks (quick wins)

* **Auth token payload typing**: authService already uses a TokenPayload interface and signs tokens with explicit `alg: HS256`, issuer, audience — good. Make sure all places that verify tokens use the same issuer/audience. ([GitHub][4])
* **Max refresh tokens logic**: double-check slice indices and revoke behavior (see earlier note). ([GitHub][4])
* **Clear dev-only logs**: patientAuthService prints verification token to console; replace with email workflow in prod. ([GitHub][14])
* **Avoid allowing empty origin by default in CORS** unless required. Tighten allowedOrigins for production. ([GitHub][1])

---

# 8) Suggested quick prioritized roadmap (what to do, in order)

**Immediate (days)**

1. Replace in-memory token blacklist with Redis-backed blacklist (or use Redis SET with TTL). Update tokenBlacklistService and authService blacklist checks. (HIGH) ([GitHub][5])
2. Run `npm audit` / update vulnerable deps found, add Snyk/GitHub Dependabot. (HIGH) ([GitHub][2])
3. Ensure deployment uses Mongo replica set (or implement DB uniqueness fallback) — update deployment docs & health checks. (HIGH) ([GitHub][12])

**Short (1–2 weeks)**
4\. Consolidate scheduling logic (single scheduling service). Refactor routes to use the canonical service. (MED) ([GitHub][15])
5\. Add Redis-based caching for availability and shared rate-limit store. (MED) ([GitHub][8])

**Medium (2–6 weeks)**
6\. Add integration tests for booking race conditions and token rotation. (MED)
7\. Add structured logging and request correlation. (MED)

**Longer-term**
8\. Add analytics / monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana) and SRE runbooks for DB outage / data corruption. (LOW)

---

# 9) Concrete code pointers and examples

A. **Example: replace in-memory blacklist with Redis (conceptual snippet)**
In `tokenBlacklistService` swap Map for Redis usage (psuedocode):

```ts
// pseudocode
import Redis from 'ioredis'
const redis = new Redis(process.env.REDIS_URL)

async addToBlacklist(token: string, expiresAt: Date) {
  const ttl = Math.ceil((expiresAt.getTime() - Date.now()) / 1000)
  const key = `blacklist:${hash(token)}`
  await redis.setex(key, ttl, '1')
}

async isBlacklisted(token: string) {
  const key = `blacklist:${hash(token)}`
  return (await redis.exists(key)) === 1
}
```

Store hashed token keys, not raw token strings, to avoid storing long secrets.

B. **Booking uniqueness fallback**
Add a `Reservation` collection with unique index `{ provider: 1, startSlotKey: 1 }`. To book: attempt `insertOne({provider, startSlotKey, createdAt})` using `writeConcern`. If insert fails due to duplicate key, slot was taken. This is useful when transactions are not available.

# 10) Final notes & what I didn't do (and can next)

* I manually reviewed and sampled the main files listed in your `backend_raw_links.txt`.&#x20;
* I did **not** run the code or run automated tests (I only inspected sources). I also did not run `npm audit` (requires runtime). If you want, I can:

  * produce a focused PR draft (code patches) for the top-priority fixes (e.g., Redis-backed blacklist + rate-limit store), or
  * run automated checks (lint/tests) if you provide a runnable environment or CI config.

---

If you'd like, I can **(pick one or more)**:

* generate a PR patch for Redis-backed token blacklist and update authService checks (I’ll create the code diff text you can apply),
* consolidate scheduling logic into a single service (I can produce a refactor plan + code sketch), or
* produce a prioritized GitHub Issue list (with exact file/line references) that you can paste into your repo.

Which of those would you like me to do next? (I can start right away with the concrete code changes you choose.)
