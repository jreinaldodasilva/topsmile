# Task 1.3: Remove Deprecated Code

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED  
**Date**: January 2025  
**Time Spent**: 15 minutes

---

## What Was Done

### 1. Searched for authStore Usages
```bash
grep -r "authStore" src/
```

**Found**: Only 2 references
- `src/store/authStore.ts` (the file itself)
- `src/store/index.ts` (export statement)

### 2. Removed Export from index.ts
Updated `src/store/index.ts` to remove the deprecated export and added a comment directing developers to use AuthContext instead.

### 3. Deleted authStore.ts
```bash
rm src/store/authStore.ts
```

### 4. Verified No Import Errors
Ran TypeScript type check:
```bash
npm run type-check
```
**Result**: ✅ No errors

### 5. Created State Management Documentation
Created comprehensive guide at `docs/STATE-MANAGEMENT.md` covering:
- Decision tree for choosing state management
- TanStack Query usage
- Context API patterns
- Zustand best practices
- Migration guide from deprecated authStore
- Common patterns and troubleshooting

---

## Results

### Before
- ❌ Deprecated `authStore.ts` causing confusion
- ❌ No clear state management documentation
- ❌ Developers unsure when to use which solution

### After
- ✅ Deprecated code removed
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation created
- ✅ Clear decision tree for state management
- ✅ Migration guide for developers
- ✅ No import errors

---

## Files Modified

1. ✅ Deleted: `src/store/authStore.ts`
2. ✅ Modified: `src/store/index.ts` (removed export)
3. ✅ Created: `docs/STATE-MANAGEMENT.md` (comprehensive guide)

---

## Success Criteria

- [x] `authStore` usages found (2 references)
- [x] `authStore.ts` deleted
- [x] Export removed from `index.ts`
- [x] No import errors (type check passed)
- [x] State management documented

---

## Documentation Highlights

The new `STATE-MANAGEMENT.md` includes:

### Decision Tree
```
Server data? → TanStack Query
Authentication? → Context API
Global UI? → Zustand
Local state? → useState
```

### Migration Guide
Shows developers how to migrate from deprecated `useAuthStore` to `AuthContext`:
```typescript
// Before (Deprecated)
import { useAuthStore } from '../store';

// After (Current)
import { useAuthState, useAuthActions } from '../contexts/AuthContext';
```

### Best Practices
- Keep state close to where it's used
- Use TanStack Query for server data
- Separate state and actions in Context
- Memoize selectors in Zustand

---

## Impact

- **Code Quality**: Removed deprecated code ✅
- **Developer Experience**: Clear documentation ✅
- **Maintainability**: Reduced confusion ✅
- **Consistency**: Single source of truth for state management ✅

---

## Next Steps

Developers can now reference `docs/STATE-MANAGEMENT.md` when deciding how to manage state in their components.
