## 🎓 Lessons from Frontend Review

The frontend review (completed in 8.5 hours vs 324h estimate) taught us:

1. **Focus on Critical Issues First** - Don't try to fix everything
2. **Minimal Code Changes** - Only change what's necessary
3. **Incremental Progress** - Small, focused tasks
4. **Measure Everything** - Track metrics before and after

**Applying to Backend:**
- Start with test suite (blocks everything else)
- Fix type safety incrementally (not all 476 at once)
- Focus on high-impact changes first
