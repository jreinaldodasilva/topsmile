## Coverage Impact

### Before
- Auth services: 0% tested
- Scheduling services: 0% tested

### After (Projected)
- Auth services: ~40% (when tests fixed)
- Scheduling services: ~30% (when tests fixed)

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1. Fix test data validation issues (1-2 hours)
2. Add missing required fields
3. Verify all tests pass

### Short Term
1. Add more edge case tests
2. Add integration tests
3. Target 80% coverage for critical services
