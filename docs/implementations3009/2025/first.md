# Changes Implemented

- **`/home/rebelde/Development/topsmile/src/mocks/handlers.ts`**  
  - Updated the `/api/auth/login` mock handler.  
  - Changed `expiresIn` to a numeric value.  
  - Added `X-Request-ID` and `Set-Cookie` to the response headers.  

- **`/home/rebelde/Development/topsmile/src/components/Auth/PasswordValidator.tsx`**  
  - Created a new file implementing `validatePassword`.  
  - Logic matches the backend’s password validation rules.  

- **`/home/rebelde/Development/topsmile/src/tests/integration/BackendContract.test.ts`**  
  - Added a new integration test suite for backend API contract validation.  
  - Includes tests for:
    - Response structure  
    - Password validation  
    - Rate limiting  
    - Account lockout  
    - Appointment conflict handling

# Assumptions Made

- `apiService` (imported in `BackendContract.test.ts`) is correctly configured to communicate with the backend.  
- The new test file (`src/tests/integration/BackendContract.test.ts`) will be detected by the test runner.  
- Scope of work was limited to implementing the described changes — tests were not executed, and resulting issues were not addressed.

# Uncertainties / Questions

- The document refers to updating `@topsmile/types` but does not specify which fields to add.  
  → No changes were made to `@topsmile/types`.  

- The document mentions implementing **CSRF token handling**, but provides no details.  
  → This was not implemented.  

- The new `BackendContract.test.ts` appears intended to run against a **real backend**, which may conflict with the existing **MSW (Mock Service Worker)** setup.  
  → Additional configuration might be required for proper execution.
