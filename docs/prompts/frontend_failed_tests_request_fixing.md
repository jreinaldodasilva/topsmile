Read the document `frontend_failed_tests`.
Review the frontend source code in the `src/` directory.
Implement fixes for the test failures described in `frontend_failed_tests`.

### Guidelines for Fixes

* **Necessity First**: Modify the frontend source code **only when absolutely required** to resolve the failures.
* **Consistency**: Ensure each fix aligns with the **existing project logic, patterns, and architecture** — do not introduce new or unrelated functionality.
* **Clarity**: Maintain coding standards (TypeScript, React best practices, and existing conventions).

### Deliverables

For each fix, provide a clear explanation that includes:

1. **Root Cause** — why the failure occurred.
2. **Solution** — what changes were made.
3. **Justification** — why the chosen solution resolves the issue without breaking existing functionality.

The final result should restore all failing tests to a passing state while preserving the integrity of the project.
