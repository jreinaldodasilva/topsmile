Please conduct an in-depth review of the frontend testing infrastructure for topsmile project, evaluating it across the following areas:

**1. Test Coverage &amp; Strategy**
- What types of tests are implemented (unit, integration, e2e)?
- Are critical business logic areas adequately covered (appointments, payments, authentication)?
- Should there be specific test coverage thresholds defined?
- Are there gaps in testing patient data handling, HIPAA compliance scenarios, or medical records?

**2. Testing Framework &amp; Tools**
- Is Jest the appropriate choice for this backend stack?
- Should there be additional testing libraries (supertest for API testing, mongodb-memory-server for database tests)?
- Are mocking strategies clearly defined for external services (Stripe, email providers)?
- Should there be load/performance testing tools (k6, Artillery)?

**3. Test Organization &amp; Structure**
- How should tests be organized (by feature, by layer, by type)?
- Are there clear naming conventions for test files and test cases?
- Should there be separate test configurations for unit vs integration tests?
- Is there a test utilities/helpers structure to reduce duplication?

**4. Database &amp; State Management**
- How are database tests isolated (separate test DB, transactions, cleanup)?
- Are there test fixtures or factories for creating test data?
- Should there be database seeding scripts for testing?
- How is Redis handled in tests (mocking vs test instance)?

**5. API Testing**
- Are all REST endpoints covered with integration tests?
- Should there be contract testing for API responses?
- Are authentication/authorization scenarios thoroughly tested?
- Should there be tests for rate limiting, validation, and error handling?

**6. External Dependencies**
- How should Stripe integration be tested (mocks vs test mode)?
- Are MongoDB operations properly tested with edge cases?
- Should there be tests for email notifications and scheduled tasks?
- How are environment-specific configurations tested?

**7. Test Execution &amp; CI/CD**
- Should there be parallel test execution for faster feedback?
- What should the test script commands include (watch mode, coverage, specific suites)?
- Are there pre-commit hooks for running tests?
- Should there be staging environment testing procedures?

**8. Security &amp; Compliance Testing**
- Should there be specific tests for data encryption and PII handling?
- Are there tests for SQL injection, XSS, and other security vulnerabilities?
- Should HIPAA compliance requirements have dedicated test suites?
- Are authentication edge cases (token expiration, refresh, revocation) tested?

**9. Documentation &amp; Maintainability**
- Should there be a testing guide for developers?
- Are complex test scenarios documented with explanations?
- Should there be examples of how to write tests for common patterns?
- Is there guidance on when to mock vs use real implementations?

**10. Monitoring &amp; Reporting**
- What coverage reporting should be implemented?
- Should there be test result dashboards or notifications?
- How should flaky tests be identified and handled?
- Should there be performance benchmarks tracked over time?

Please provide specific recommendations including:
- Missing test types or scenarios
- Suggested testing tools and libraries
- Example test structure and organization
- Best practices for testing medical/HIPAA-compliant systems
- Sample test code for critical flows (appointment booking, payment processing)
- CI/CD integration suggestions
