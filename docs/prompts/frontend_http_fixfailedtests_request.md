# Frontend HTTP Service Failed Tests - Root Cause Resolution Plan

This document outlines a **root cause-driven TODO checklist** organized by test suite. The goal is not just to silence errors, but to identify and fix the underlying problems in the codebase to prevent future regressions.

## Resolution Principles

- [ ] **Reproduce Failures**: Run failing tests individually to confirm reproducibility.
- [ ] **Root Cause Analysis**: Identify whether the issue lies in the implementation, test setup, or environment.
- [ ] **Code Improvements**: Apply meaningful fixes to prevent recurrence (not just adjusting test expectations).
- [ ] **Regression Testing**: Re-run the full test suite and related modules to validate stability.


## Suite: http service

- [ ] **Test:** http service request function successful requests should make successful GET request without auth
  - File/Class: `http service request function successful requests should make successful GET request without auth`
  - Observed Issue: Error: Network request failed
  - Root Cause Tasks:
    - [ ] Investigate why this failure occurs (code, mock, or environment issue).
    - [ ] Implement a proper fix in the source code or test logic.
    - [ ] Ensure similar cases are covered to prevent recurrence.
    - [ ] Re-run the test to confirm the issue is fully resolved.

  - File/Class: `http service request function successful requests should make successful POST request with auth`
  - Observed Issue: Error: Network request failed
  - Root Cause Tasks:
    - [ ] Investigate why this failure occurs (code, mock, or environment issue).
    - [ ] Implement a proper fix in the source code or test logic.

    - [ ] Ensure similar cases are covered to prevent recurrence.
    - [ ] Re-run the test to confirm the issue is fully resolved.
