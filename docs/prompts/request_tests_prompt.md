Your task is to fix the backend tests of the TopSmile project until they are all running without failures.

⚠️ Strict Rules:  
- Only modify the test files. Modify the backend's source code only if it is strictly necessary.  
- Fix **one failing test at a time**, then rerun it before moving on.  
- Each fix must adapt the test to the existing project code — do not invent new functionality.  
- Always explain what was fixed and why.    

1. **Fix One Test at a Time**  
   - Review the `backend/reports/junit-backend.xml`
   - Select the first failing test.  
   - Modify only that test file to resolve the issue.  
   - Explain the change and how it matches the project code.  
   - Rerun just that test to confirm it passes.  
   - Stop and report results before continuing.  

2. **Repeat**  
   - Continue fixing failing tests one by one until the suite passes.  
   - Never modify multiple tests at once.  
   - Do not skip tests — every failing test must be addressed.
