# Critical Blockers Analysis - TopSmile Repository

## Objective
Identify and document all critical issues that prevent successful builds, deployments, or runtime execution of the TopSmile monorepo.

## Scope
Analyze the TypeScript/Node.js monorepo including:
- Backend API services
- Shared types package
- Frontend components
- Build configurations
- Dependency management

## Analysis Checklist

### 1. Build System Issues
- [ ] Check `package.json` scripts in all packages for syntax errors
- [ ] Verify TypeScript `tsconfig.json` configurations (paths, outDir, moduleResolution)
- [ ] Identify missing or mismatched dependencies in package.json files
- [ ] Check for circular dependencies between packages
- [ ] Verify workspace configuration (if using npm/yarn/pnpm workspaces)
- [ ] Test for broken imports/module resolution
- [ ] Check for missing `@types/*` packages

### 2. Runtime Blockers
- [ ] Identify unhandled promise rejections without `.catch()`
- [ ] Find synchronous code blocking the event loop (large sync file reads, crypto operations)
- [ ] Check for missing environment variables that cause crashes on startup
- [ ] Verify database connection initialization and error handling
- [ ] Check for missing graceful shutdown handlers
- [ ] Identify uncaught exceptions in critical startup code

### 3. TypeScript Compilation Errors
- [ ] Run `tsc --noEmit` and document all compilation errors
- [ ] Check for incompatible type definitions across packages
- [ ] Identify `@ts-ignore` comments masking real errors
- [ ] Verify generic type constraints are properly defined
- [ ] Check for missing type exports from shared packages

### 4. Dependency Conflicts
- [ ] Check for version mismatches in shared dependencies across packages
- [ ] Identify deprecated packages with breaking changes
- [ ] Verify peer dependency requirements are met
- [ ] Check for conflicting typings from multiple sources

### 5. Configuration Errors
- [ ] Validate environment variable schemas (missing required vars)
- [ ] Check for malformed JSON/YAML config files
- [ ] Verify port conflicts in development configuration
- [ ] Check database connection strings and credentials handling
- [ ] Validate API endpoint configurations

## Deliverable Format

Create `CRITICAL_BLOCKERS.md` with:

```markdown
# Critical Blockers Report

## Executive Summary
- Total blocking issues: [X]
- Estimated fix time: [Y hours]
- Build success probability: [%]

## Immediate Action Items (Priority Order)

### BLOCKER-001: [Title]
**Severity**: Critical
**Impact**: Prevents [build/startup/deployment]
**Location**: `path/to/file:L10-L25`

**Problem**:
[Detailed explanation of the issue]

**Evidence**:
```
[Error message or stack trace]
```

**Root Cause**:
[Why this is happening]

**Fix Required**:
```typescript
// Before
[problematic code]

// After
[corrected code]
```

**Verification Steps**:
1. Apply the fix
2. Run `npm run build` (or specific command)
3. Verify [expected outcome]

**Risk Level**: Low/Medium/High
**Confidence**: High/Medium/Low

[Repeat for each blocker]

## Dependencies Graph (if circular dependencies found)
```
Package A -> Package B -> Package C -> Package A
```

## Recommended Fix Order
1. [Issue ID]: [Reason for priority]
2. [Issue ID]: [Reason for priority]
...

## Assumptions Made
- [List any assumptions about environment, versions, etc.]
```

## Output Files

1. `CRITICAL_BLOCKERS.md` - Main report
2. `blockers.json` - Machine-readable format:
```json
{
  "summary": {
    "totalBlockers": 0,
    "buildBlockers": 0,
    "runtimeBlockers": 0,
    "configBlockers": 0
  },
  "issues": [
    {
      "id": "BLOCKER-001",
      "title": "",
      "category": "build|runtime|config|dependency",
      "severity": "Critical",
      "file": "",
      "lineRange": "",
      "errorMessage": "",
      "suggestedFix": "",
      "verificationCommand": "",
      "estimatedFixTime": "minutes",
      "blocksDevelopment": true,
      "blocksProduction": true
    }
  ]
}
```
3. `patches/blockers/` - Git-compatible patches for each fix

## Success Criteria
- All critical build blockers documented with reproduction steps
- Each blocker has a concrete, testable fix
- Fixes are ordered by dependency (fix A before B)
- No false positives (verify each is truly blocking)

## Commands to Run
```bash
# Build verification
npm run build --workspaces

# Type checking
npx tsc --noEmit --project tsconfig.json

# Dependency audit
npm ls --all

# Start services (look for startup crashes)
npm run dev
```

## Notes
- Focus ONLY on issues that completely prevent functionality
- Exclude warnings, linting errors, or "nice-to-have" fixes
- Provide minimal, surgical patches - no refactoring
- Mark confidence level for each finding
