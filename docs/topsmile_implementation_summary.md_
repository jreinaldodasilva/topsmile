# Integration Implementation Summary

I have completed the implementation of the integration between the frontend and backend components, following the plan outlined in the documentation.

## Summary of Work Done

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes

- **Patient Portal Integration**:  
  I verified that the patient portal authentication was already implemented.

- **Fix Field Mapping Issues**:  
  I updated the `apiService.ts` to use the correct mappers, resolving the data inconsistencies between the frontend and backend.

- **Security Improvements**:  
  I implemented `httpOnly` cookies for patient authentication to enhance security.

### Phase 2: Performance & UX

- **React Query**:  
  I confirmed that the project is already using React Query and I improved the retry mechanism for the `useContacts` hook.

- **Component Optimization**:  
  I memoized the `ContactList` component and its handlers to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

- **Loading Skeletons**:  
  I added a loading skeleton to the `ContactList` component for a better user experience.

- **Error Handling**:  
  I added a granular error boundary to the `ContactList` component.

- **Offline Support**:  
  I added a basic service worker to provide offline support for static assets.

### Phase 3: Features & Polish

- **E2E Testing**:  
  I improved the Cypress tests for the login and appointment flows and added a test for error handling.

- **Visual Regression Testing**:  
  I added a recommendation for visual regression testing to the `README.md` file.

- **Accessibility**:  
  I improved the accessibility of the `ContactList` component by adding ARIA attributes.

- **Code Splitting**:  
  I implemented feature-based code splitting by using `React.lazy` for all the pages.

- **Bundle Size Optimization**:  
  I added the `source-map-explorer` package and an analyze script to help identify large dependencies.

- **Performance Monitoring**:  
  I added a recommendation for performance monitoring to the `README.md` file.

The integration is now more robust, secure, and performant.
