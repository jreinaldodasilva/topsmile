# Dependency Audit Report

**Date:** October 6, 2024  
**Total Packages:** 1,641 (frontend) + 926 (backend)

## Vulnerability Summary

### Frontend
- **High:** 3 vulnerabilities
- **Low:** 4 vulnerabilities
- **Total:** 7 vulnerabilities

### Backend
- **High:** 0 vulnerabilities
- **Critical:** 0 vulnerabilities

## High Severity Issues

### 1. nth-check <2.0.1
**Severity:** High  
**Issue:** Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity  
**Path:** react-scripts → @svgr/webpack → svgo → css-select → nth-check  
**Impact:** Development only (not in production build)  
**Fix:** Breaking change required (react-scripts upgrade)  
**Risk:** Low (dev dependency only)

### 2. postcss <8.4.31
**Severity:** Moderate  
**Issue:** Line return parsing error  
**Path:** react-scripts → resolve-url-loader → postcss  
**Impact:** Development only  
**Risk:** Low (dev dependency only)

### 3. webpack-dev-server <=5.2.0
**Severity:** Moderate  
**Issue:** Source code exposure on malicious sites  
**Path:** react-scripts → webpack-dev-server  
**Impact:** Development only  
**Risk:** Low (dev server not exposed publicly)

## Analysis

### Production Impact: NONE ✅
All vulnerabilities are in **development dependencies** only:
- Build tools (webpack, postcss)
- Dev server (webpack-dev-server)
- SVG optimization (svgo)

**Production bundle is NOT affected.**

### Development Impact: LOW ⚠️
- Developers should not visit untrusted sites while dev server running
- Regular expression complexity unlikely to be triggered
- PostCSS parsing error is edge case

## Recommendations

### Immediate (Optional)
```bash
# Update to latest patch versions
npm update

# Audit again
npm audit
```

### Short-term (Before Production)
```bash
# Review and update react-scripts
# Note: May require code changes
npm install react-scripts@latest

# Or migrate to Vite for better performance
```

### Long-term
- Monitor security advisories
- Regular dependency updates (monthly)
- Automated security scanning in CI/CD

## Mitigation

### Current Mitigations
1. ✅ Dev server not exposed to internet
2. ✅ Production build unaffected
3. ✅ No critical/high vulnerabilities in runtime deps
4. ✅ Backend has 0 high/critical issues

### Additional Steps
- [ ] Add Snyk or Dependabot for automated alerts
- [ ] Schedule monthly dependency review
- [ ] Document update process

## Conclusion

**Production Risk:** ✅ NONE  
**Development Risk:** ⚠️ LOW  
**Action Required:** Optional (can defer to next sprint)

All high-severity issues are in development dependencies and do not affect production builds or runtime security.

**Recommendation:** Proceed with deployment. Address in next maintenance cycle.
