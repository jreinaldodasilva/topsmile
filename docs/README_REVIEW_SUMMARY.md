4. No automatic token refresh
5. No session timeout

### 2. Enhancement Plan Review
**File:** `docs/ENHANCEMENT_PLAN_REVIEW.md`
**Grade:** B (Good but outdated)

**Key Finding:**
- Original plan lists features as "missing" that are already implemented
- Plan assumes 0% complete, reality is 67% complete
- Phases 1-5 are mostly complete
- Need to focus on frontend integration, not backend development

**Impact:**
- Saves 4 weeks on Phase 3 (components exist)
- Reduces budget by ~$50k
- Changes focus from building to integrating

### 3. Updated Enhancement Plan
**File:** `docs/UPDATED_ENHANCEMENT_PLAN.md`

**Revised Timeline:**
- Phase 1: Security fixes (2 weeks) - CRITICAL
- Phase 2: Documentation (1 week) - CRITICAL
- Phase 3: Component integration (2 weeks) - HIGH
- Phase 4: Real-time features (4 weeks) - MEDIUM
- Phase 5: Advanced features (4 weeks) - LOW
- Phase 6: Infrastructure (3 weeks) - LOW
- **Total:** 16 weeks (vs 24 weeks original)

**Revised Budget:**
- $201,250 (vs $186k-252k original)
- More accurate based on actual remaining work

### 4. Component Interaction Analysis
**File:** `docs/COMPONENT_INTERACTION_ANALYSIS.md`

**Key Findings:**
- ✅ Clinical components ARE implemented
- ❌ Components use localStorage tokens (security issue)
- ⚠️ Components not integrated into main patient workflow
- ⚠️ Missing apiService methods for clinical features

**Components Found:**
- Dental Chart (7 sub-components)
- Treatment Plan (5 sub-components)
- Clinical Notes (4 sub-components)
- Medical History (5 sub-components)

### 5. Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate (Tomorrow)

1. **Add apiService methods:**
```typescript
// src/services/apiService.ts
dentalCharts: {
  getLatest: async (patientId: string) => { ... },
  getHistory: async (patientId: string) => { ... },
  create: async (data: any) => { ... },
  update: async (id: string, data: any) => { ... }
}
```

2. **Update DentalChart component:**
```typescript
// Replace:
const token = localStorage.getItem('token');
const response = await fetch(url, {
  headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}` }
});

// With:
const response = await apiService.dentalCharts.getLatest(patientId);
```

3. **Update RoleManagement component:**
```typescript
// Same pattern as DentalChart
```

### Week 1 (Days 2-5)

4. Verify all components use apiService
