Index Analysis Results
======================
Date: December 2024
Database: TopSmile

Key Findings:
-------------
1. Most indexes show 0 operations (unused since last server restart)
2. All indexes have "Last used" dates, indicating they were created but not actively used
3. Many single-field indexes that could be covered by compound indexes

Collections Analyzed:
--------------------
- contacts: 17 indexes (most unused)
- appointments: Multiple indexes
- patients: Multiple indexes
- providers: Multiple indexes
- users: Multiple indexes

Recommendations:
---------------
1. Remove unused single-field indexes covered by compound indexes
2. Keep compound indexes for common query patterns
3. Monitor index usage after removal
4. Consider adding missing compound indexes for frequent queries

Action Items:
------------
- Review each collection's query patterns
- Remove redundant indexes
- Add missing compound indexes
- Re-run analysis after changes

Note: Index usage stats reset on server restart, so low usage may not indicate truly unused indexes.
Consider monitoring over a longer period in production.
