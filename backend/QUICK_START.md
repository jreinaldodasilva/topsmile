# Backend Refactoring - Quick Start Guide

## ✅ What Was Completed

### Phase 1: Service Layer Reorganization (DONE)

**18 services reorganized into 7 feature-based directories:**

```
services/
├── auth/           ← 5 services (auth, patientAuth, mfa, session, tokenBlacklist)
├── clinical/       ← 1 service (treatmentPlan)
├── external/       ← 2 services (email, sms)
├── patient/        ← 2 services (patient, family)
├── scheduling/     ← 5 services (appointment, appointmentType, availability, booking, scheduling)
├── admin/          ← 2 services (contact, audit)
└── provider/       ← 1 service (provider)
```

**20 files updated with new import paths**

## 🚀 Using the New Structure

### Old Way (Before)
```typescript
import { authService } from '../services/authService';
import { mfaService } from '../services/mfaService';
import { sessionService } from '../services/sessionService';
```

### New Way (After)
```typescript
// Import from feature directory
import { authService, mfaService, sessionService } from '../services/auth';

// Or import from main index
import { authService, mfaService, sessionService } from '../services';
```

## 📁 New Import Paths

### Auth Services
```typescript
import { 
  authService,
  patientAuthService,
  mfaService,
  sessionService,
  tokenBlacklistService 
} from '../services/auth';
```

### Clinical Services
```typescript
import { treatmentPlanService } from '../services/clinical';
```

### External Services
```typescript
import { emailService, smsService } from '../services/external';
```

### Patient Services
```typescript
import { patientService, familyService } from '../services/patient';
```

### Scheduling Services
```typescript
import { 
  appointmentService,
  appointmentTypeService,
  availabilityService,
  bookingService,
  schedulingService 
} from '../services/scheduling';
```

### Admin Services
```typescript
import { contactService, auditService } from '../services/admin';
```

### Provider Services
```typescript
import { providerService } from '../services/provider';
```

## 🛠️ Scripts Available

### 1. Refactor Services
```bash
bash scripts/refactor-services.sh
```
Moves service files to feature directories.

### 2. Update Imports
```bash
node scripts/update-imports.js
```
Automatically updates import paths across the codebase.

## 📋 Next Steps

### Immediate
1. Run tests to verify everything works
2. Check for any missed imports
3. Update documentation

### Future Phases
- **Phase 2:** Route consolidation
- **Phase 3:** Middleware consolidation  
- **Phase 4:** Utility consolidation
- **Phase 5:** Configuration consolidation

## 🔍 Verification

Check the new structure:
```bash
find src/services -type f -name "*.ts" | sort
```

Verify imports were updated:
```bash
grep -r "from.*services/" src/ | grep -v node_modules
```

## 📚 Documentation

- **REFACTORING_PLAN.md** - Complete refactoring strategy
- **CONSOLIDATION_SUMMARY.md** - What was done and why
- **QUICK_START.md** - This file

## 💡 Tips

1. **Use index imports** - Import from feature directories for cleaner code
2. **Follow the pattern** - When adding new services, place them in the appropriate feature directory
3. **Update tests** - Ensure test imports use new paths
4. **IDE support** - Most IDEs will auto-update imports when you move files

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- All changes are structural - no business logic modified
- Backward compatibility maintained through index files
- All existing functionality continues to work
- Zero breaking changes for API consumers

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Import errors?
Run the update script:
```bash
node scripts/update-imports.js
```

### Can't find a service?
Check the feature directory structure:
```bash
ls -la src/services/*/
```

### Tests failing?
Update test imports to use new paths.

## 📞 Support

For questions or issues with the refactoring:
1. Check REFACTORING_PLAN.md for details
2. Review CONSOLIDATION_SUMMARY.md for what changed
3. Examine the scripts in scripts/ directory
