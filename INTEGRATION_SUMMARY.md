## Conclusion

**Current State**: The frontend has solid API integration with all backend endpoints accessible. Basic CRUD operations work for all major entities. However, many advanced features and backend fields are not yet exposed in the UI.

**Priority**: Focus on integrating critical missing fields (emergency contact ✅, insurance, recurring appointments, operatory management) before moving to advanced features.

**Timeline**: With focused effort, critical integrations can be completed in 2-3 weeks, with full integration taking 8-12 weeks.

**Risk**: Low - All API methods exist, just need UI components. No breaking changes required.
