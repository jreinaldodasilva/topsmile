# Testing Infrastructure Implementation - Summary

**Date**: January 2025  
**Status**: Phase 1 In Progress - Critical Fix Completed

---

## What Was Done

### 1. Comprehensive Audit Completed ‚úÖ
- Analyzed 68 test files across backend, frontend, and E2E
- Identified 121 failing tests (44% failure rate)
- Discovered actual coverage is 17% vs documented 82%
- Created detailed audit report with prioritized recommendations

### 2. Critical Auth Bug Fixed ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Backend integration tests failing with 401 Unauthorized

**Root Cause**: 
```typescript
// authService instantiated BEFORE env vars set
export const authService = new AuthService(); // JWT_SECRET undefined here!
```

**Solution**:
```typescript
// backend/tests/setup.ts - Set env vars FIRST
import { TEST_CREDENTIALS } from './testConstants';
process.env.JWT_SECRET = TEST_CREDENTIALS.JWT_SECRET;
process.env.PATIENT_JWT_SECRET = TEST_CREDENTIALS.PATIENT_JWT_SECRET;

// THEN import services
import mongoose from 'mongoose';
```

**Impact**:
- ‚úÖ Integration test pass rate: 0% ‚Üí 42% (16/38 passing)
- ‚úÖ All auth-related failures resolved
- ‚úÖ Foundation for accurate coverage measurement

### 3. Frontend Test Timeout Increased ‚úÖ
- Increased from 8s to 10s to handle async operations
- MSW setup verified as correct
- 86 tests still failing (need further investigation)
