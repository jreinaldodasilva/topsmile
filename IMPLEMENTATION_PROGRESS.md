3. **Validation**: Ensuring all required fields are validated properly

### Best Practices Applied
1. **Minimal Code**: Only essential code, no over-engineering
2. **Type Safety**: Strict TypeScript usage throughout
3. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try-catch blocks
4. **User Experience**: Clear labels, helpful messages, loading states
5. **Code Organization**: Logical file structure and component composition
