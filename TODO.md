## Summary of Completed Improvements

### ✅ Route Protection
- Created PatientProtectedRoute component for consistent patient authentication
- Updated App.tsx to use PatientProtectedRoute for all patient routes (/patient/dashboard, /patient/appointments, etc.)
- Patient login/register routes remain unprotected as expected

### ✅ API Hooks Enhancement
- Added useAppointments hook with full CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete)
- Added usePatients hook with full CRUD operations
- Added useProviders hook with full CRUD operations  
- Added useForms hook for form templates and responses
- Added useCalendar hook for calendar events
- All hooks include proper error handling and optimistic updates

### ✅ Component Integration
- Updated PatientDashboard to use useAppointments hook instead of direct apiService calls
- Improved data fetching patterns with consistent loading/error states
- Enhanced type safety with null checks

### ✅ Code Quality
- Consistent error handling across all new hooks
- Proper TypeScript typing
- Optimistic UI updates for better UX
- Separation of concerns with specialized hooks

## Remaining Tasks (Optional Future Enhancements)

### Error Handling & Loading States
- Review and enhance error handling consistency across remaining components
- Improve loading state indicators in other pages
- Add better error messages and retry mechanisms

### Integration Verification
- Verify all backend endpoints are accessible from frontend
- Test API calls work correctly in different scenarios
- Check type safety across all integrations

### Component Updates
- Update remaining components to use new hooks where applicable
- Ensure consistent data fetching patterns throughout the app
